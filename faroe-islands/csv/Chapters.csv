DAY 1 - ARRIVAL,,,,"<p align:""center"">Vágar Airport to Kollafjørður to Saksun</P>
After arriving in the Faroe Islands we drove to Kollafjørður to check-in to our AirBNB for the next couple of days. Then we took a quick drive north to the old village of Saksun for Lunch. 
<br>
The rest of the day was spent talking to our host, learning a bit about the Faroe Islands and making plans for the next few days. ",11,Hidden,,Vágar Airport,62.16037174,-7.109527588,,,geojson/arrival.geojson,color:black;weight:3

"DAY 2 - HIKE FROM TJØRNUVIK
<p align:""left"">We decided to start our tour of the Islands with the trail from Tjørnuvik to Saksun. It has a very steep ascent out of Tjørnuvik, it's difficult, but because of the quick ascent you get a beautiful view of the town and it's beach.</p>",/faroe-islands/img/1.png,,,"This hike taught us an important lesson about hiking in the Faroe islands. It is very difficult to judge the distances you are looking at. I suspect, because of the lack of trees, there are no visual clues as to the scale. In the end this means things tend to be much farther than they look.",13,Hidden,green-dark,Tjørnuvík,62.27439226,-7.183170319,,,geojson/tjornuvik.geojson,color:black;weight:3

"DAY 3 - PUFFINS
<p>Middagsfjall</p>",/faroe-islands/img/Faroe Islands 2021 - 1 of 1 (2).png,View from Middagsfjall,,"One of the great things about the Faroe Islands is they're pretty small, so you can drive just about anywhere in a short time and it's photo-perfect landscape every moment of the drive. We headed north from Kollafjørður past Slættaratindur (the highest peak) to hike Middagsfjall. ",13,,,,62.30741759,-6.944088936,,,,
The Cliffs Above Gjógv,/faroe-islands/img/puffin.jpg,We saw puffins for the first time!,,From Middagsfjall we set out for the town of Gjógv. From Gjógv we set out on a short but very step hike north of town. Their was a steep slope down to the town behind us and in front of us a sheer drop into the Atlantic Ocean. The cliff is dotted with Puffins diving down for fish and then returning to their ledges.,16,Plain,green-dark,,62.29155798,-6.937351227,,,,
DAY 4 - KALLUR LIGHTHOUSE,/faroe-islands/img/lighthouse.jpg,,,"While most of the larger islands are connected by bridges or sub-sea tunnels, the island of Kalsoy is not. So that meant boarding the a ferry for the trip to the iconic Kallur Lighthouse. ",16,Plain,green-dark,,62.37016545,-6.811587811,,,,

DAY 5 - OLD POSTAL ROUTE TO GÁSADALUR,/faroe-islands/img/gasadalur2.jpeg,The Iconic Waterfall of Gásadalur,,"Perhaps my favorite hike of the trip was the ""Old Postal Route to Gásadalur"". So named because, until 20xx, the town of Gásadalur was not accesible by road and a post-worker had to make the hike along the exposed side of the mountain to the town to deliver mail. The hike also brings you into town right past the spot of perhaps the most iconic scene from the Faroe isalnds:",14,Hidden,,,62.09753696,-7.410793304,,,geojson/gasadalur.geojson,color:black;weight:3

KOKS,/faroe-islands/img/LandRover.jpeg,Land Rover and the receiving cabin where you wait for everyone to arrive.,,"Most of our meals while traveling are homemade meals from local foods we find at grocery stores but we decided to make an exception for Koks. Koks is a 2 Michelin Star restaurant in a low, grass-roofed house situated at the base of a mountain. The location has since moved but at the time they picked you up in a classic Land Rover Defender for a short drive along the edge of a lake to dinner",,,,,,,,,,

DAY 6 - THE JOURNEY TO FUGLOY,/faroe-islands/img/helicopter.jpg,Loading for our first helicopter flight.,,"The Island of Fugloy is more remote than some and while there is a ferry, it often can't dock due to rough weather, so a helicopter flys daily to and from Fugloy for the dozen or so residents of the island to bring supplies or allow them to come and go more easily. The Danish government subsidizes the helicopter, this means non-residents can fly very cheaply to Fugloy. However, you're only allowed a one-way flight which means, after arriving in Kirkja you must travel to the other town, Hattarvik in order to catch the ferry back to the ""mainland"". Be sure to call the ferry to let them know you need a ride. ",11,,,,62.28038141,-6.405715942,,,geojson/fugloy.geojson,color:black;weight:3

,/faroe-islands/img/clareBoat.jpg,Ferry rides are a great way to get a unique look at the islands from the water.,,"Hattarvik, where you board the ferry, faces the open ocean. This means the water can be quite rough and you'll have to jump on to the ferry as it rides the large waves.",11,,,,62.31262251,-6.348381042,,,,

DAY 7 - SUMMIT,/faroe-islands/img/Summit.jpeg,,,"We hiked Slættaratindur, the highest peak in the Faroe Islands. It was a beautiful day, but there was a thick fog covering the peak.",13,,,,62.2969053,-7.013397217,,,,
DAY 8 - SUNDAY,/faroe-islands/img/journal.jpeg,Visited Nordichouse Arts Center for coffe and filling in the journal.,,"We took a day off from hiking to explore a little more of the history of the island at the Faroe Islands National Museum in Tórshavn. There is so much to explore from the history of how the islands formed, to how they were settled and even a small cluster of buildings showing traditional building techniques and how people have lived there in the past. ",,,,,,,,,,
DAY 9 - FINAL HIKE,/faroe-islands/img/lastHike.jpg,,,For our final hike we went as far north as you can drive to hike Villingadalsfjall. Probably one of the most difficult hikes we did as there were many false peaks and everything was much father away than it appeared. A very appropriate send-off from the Islands. ,,,,,,,,,,
,/faroe-islands/img/clarePainting.jpg,,,Clare took some time to paint and we took some photos of the Travel Watercolor Painting Kit that we had been developing. ,,,,,,,,,,
DAY 10 - TO COPENHAGEN,/faroe-islands/img/domeHome.jpeg,,,Our last day in the islands we toward Bøur and drove around until we found these little Geo-Dome Houses that Clare had heard about. From their we headed to the airport for a short flight and an overnight stay in Copenhagen. ,,,,,,,,,,
,/faroe-islands/img/nightBike.jpeg,,,Bikes are everywhere in Copenhagen and so of course we rented some bikes and took a quick ride through the city and along the water.,15,,,,55.66922318,12.57496834,,,,
,/faroe-islands/img/copenhagenRoomLight.gif,,,We booked a room at CityHub and were not dissapointed. We made sure to get up early in the morning to have a short session in the sauna. ,,,,,,,,,,
DAY 11 - HOME ,/faroe-islands/img/airportBike.jpeg,,,"The original plan was to catch a bus back to the airport but after discovering the bike rentals we opted for the authentic Danish experience and rode bikes, bags strapped on, to the airport. ",,,,,,,,,,
